[Sessions](https://ktor.io/docs/sessions.html) provide a mechanism to persist data between different HTTP requests. Typical use cases include storing a logged-in user's ID, the contents of a shopping basket, or keeping user preferences on the client. In Ktor, you can implement sessions by using cookies or custom headers, choose whether to store session data on the server or pass it to the client, sign and encrypt session data, and more.

## Usage

Before installing a session, you need to create a data class for storing session data, for example:
```kotlin
data class UserSession(val id: String, val count: Int)
```
After creating the required data classes, you can install the `Sessions` plugin by passing it to the `install` function in the application initialization code. Inside the `install` block, call the `cookie` or `header` function depending on how you want to pass data between the server and client:
```kotlin
install(Sessions) {
    cookie<UserSession>("user_session")
}
```
