[Routing](https://ktor.io/docs/routing-in-ktor.html) is the core Ktor plugin for handling incoming requests in a server application. When the client makes a request to a specific URL (for example, `/hello`), the routing mechanism allows us to define how we want this request to be served.

## Usage

The Routing plugin can be installed by calling the `routing` function. After installing the Routing plugin, you can call the `route` function inside `routing` to define a route:
```kotlin
routing {
    route("/hello", HttpMethod.Get) {
        handle {
            call.respondText("Hello")
        }
    }
}
```

Ktor also provides a series of functions that make defining route handlers much easier and more concise. For example, you can replace the previous code with a get function that now only needs to take the URL and the code to handle the request:

```kotlin
routing {
    get("/hello") {
        call.respondText("Hello")
    }
}
```
